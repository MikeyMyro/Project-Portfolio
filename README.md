1. Baseball Performance Analytics

Overview

Analyzed offseason pitching and hitting data using Python and visualized performance metrics using Tableau. Created automated scripts to clean, process, and generate insights from large datasets.

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data processing

CSV data management for handling large baseball datasets

Statistical analysis of key performance metrics (e.g., exit velocity, strike rates, OPS)

Tableau for data visualization

Features

Automated data cleaning and standardization

Computation of key baseball stats (strikeout rate, walk rate, slugging percentage, etc.)

Generation of CSV reports for visualization

Interactive dashboards in Tableau

How to Run

Ensure all dependencies (pandas, numpy) are installed.

Place the cleaned baseball dataset in the project directory.

Run the Python scripts to generate statistical insights.

Load the CSV outputs into Tableau for visualization.

2. Autonomous Racing Bots

Overview

Developed Python-based control systems for autonomous robots competing in the One-Meter Dash and Marathon events. The robots were programmed to navigate autonomously using motor control, line-following algorithms, and obstacle detection.

Technologies Used

MicroPython for embedded programming

PWM motor control for precise speed adjustments

Ultrasonic distance sensors for obstacle detection

Async programming using asyncio for state management

Features

Line-following using real-time sensor data

Obstacle detection and avoidance

Optimized motor control for efficient movement

State-based decision-making for navigation

How to Run

Flash the MicroPython firmware onto the microcontroller.

Upload the provided scripts (one_meter_dash.py, marathon.py).

Power on the bot and press the start button to begin.

3. CSCI 205 - Software Engineering and Design

Overview

Developed a modified clone of the NYT game Connections with multiple difficulty levels, built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

Technologies Used

Java (JavaFX) for UI and game logic

JUnit for testing

CSS for UI styling

Git/GitLab for version control

Features

Interactive 4x4 word grid gameplay

5 difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme, Hollywood

Shuffle and return buttons for better gameplay control

Hints to guide players when close to a correct category

Modular MVC architecture for scalability

How to Run

Install JavaFX and ensure Java 11+ is set up.

Clone the repository and navigate to the main project directory.

Run ConnectionsMain.java to start the game.

Select a difficulty level and start playing.
